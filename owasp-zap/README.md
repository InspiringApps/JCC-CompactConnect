# OWASP Zed Attack Proxy

[ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) is a security pen testing tool, which this project uses for active scanning for
vulnerabilities. To manually run a scan similar to the ones integrated into [our GitHub Actions](../.github/workflows),
run `./manual-scan.sh` from a command line. Note, this requires that you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your computer. Below is a brief explanation of the pieces of this integration and what they are for.

# Authenticator

The [authenticator](./authenticator) directory is a simple NodeJS script that leverages
[aws-amplify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-amplify) to quickly log a test user in and acquire an token for
authentication. This script requires that the Cognit UserPool Client be configured to enable the SRP authentication
flow, which can only be activated in pre-production environments.

# Data

The [data](./data) folder contains configuration and automation data files that are used to control ZAP's scan. This
includes an HttpSender script and an automation YML file. The HTTPSender script will tell ZAP to add the token we acquired from the [authenticator](#authenticator) script into the `Authorization` header for every 'in scope' request, headed
to the UI or API. The YML file defines what jobs are to be run as part of an automated scan.

# Session

The [session](./session) folder is a destination folder for reports generated by ZAP.
