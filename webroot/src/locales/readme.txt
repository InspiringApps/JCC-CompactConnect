- This readme.txt file does not need to be translated. It is a read-only instruction for translating the non-English .json files in this folder.
- The English .json file (en.json) is already up-to-date and can be used as a reference for updating non-English files.
- Non-English .json files (e.g. es.json) are meant to ultimately have **English key names** and **non-English values**.
    - Examples:
        - "frequency": "Frecuencia",
        - "firstName": "Nombre",
        - "saving": "Guardando...",
- Another way to state the above:
    - "leaveThisAsIs": "Translate this"
    - All the key names (left side of :) across all the .json files should match exactly and not need to be touched.
    - All the values (right side of :) in all the non-English .json files should be checked for translation completeness.
- The overall goal is to make the non-English files values fully translated, so that they are 1-for-1 replacements with the English file.
- Some values in non-English files may already be translated. This is OK and they should be checked for accuracy and completeness.
- You may choose to edit the non-English files directly, or make copies and edit those (either is fine).
- Please return this translation bundle to us in the same folder structure you received it.
- Thank you!
