# Phase 3: S3 Bucket Backup Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 3 of the data retention feature, which adds S3 bucket backup functionality to CompactConnect.

## Overview

Phase 3 extends the backup architecture established in Phase 2 to include S3 resources containing primary data that requires backup protection. The implementation follows the same distributed backup approach where each resource manages its own backup plan using common constructs.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backup Policy Configuration

Added `document_storage` backup policy to all CDK context files:

```json
{
  "document_storage": {
    "schedule": "cron(0 3 * * ? *)",
    "delete_after_days": 2555,
    "cold_storage_after_days": 90
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Daily backups at 3 AM UTC to meet 1-day RPO requirement
- 7-year retention (2555 days) for document storage compliance
- 90-day cold storage transition for cost optimization

### 2. BucketBackupPlan Construct

Created `BucketBackupPlan` in `common_constructs/backup_plan.py`:

```python
class BucketBackupPlan(Construct):
    """
    Common construct for creating backup plans for S3 buckets with cross-account replication.
    """
```

**Features:**
- Follows same pattern as existing `TableBackupPlan`
- Uses `BackupResource.from_arn(bucket.bucket_arn)` for S3 integration
- Includes cross-account copy actions for disaster recovery
- Configurable backup policies from CDK context

### 3. ProviderUsersBucket Backup Integration

Updated `ProviderUsersBucket` to include backup functionality:

```python
# Set up backup plan for document storage if backup infrastructure is provided
if backup_infrastructure_stack and environment_context:
    self.backup_plan = BucketBackupPlan(
        self,
        'ProviderUsersBucketBackup',
        bucket=self,
        backup_vault=backup_infrastructure_stack.local_backup_vault,
        backup_service_role=backup_infrastructure_stack.backup_service_role,
        cross_account_backup_vault=backup_infrastructure_stack.cross_account_backup_vault,
        backup_policy=environment_context['backup_policies']['document_storage'],
    )
```

**Benefits:**
- Protects provider documents (military affiliation records, etc.)
- Uses existing backup infrastructure from Phase 2
- Maintains same security standards as original bucket

### 4. Bucket Selection Criteria

**Included for Backup:**
- `ProviderUsersBucket` - Contains irreplaceable provider documents

**Explicitly Excluded:**
- `BulkUploadsBucket` - Transitory data during upload processing
- `TransactionReportsBucket` - Derived reports that can be regenerated
- Frontend UI buckets - Build artifacts replaced on each deploy

### 5. Test Updates

Updated `tests/app/base.py` to validate S3 backup functionality:

- Increased expected backup plan count from 6 to 7
- Increased expected backup selection count from 6 to 7
- Added specific validation for `ProviderUsersBucket` backup plan and selection
- Updated validation loops to handle both tables and buckets

## Architecture Integration

The S3 backup implementation seamlessly integrates with existing Phase 2 infrastructure:

1. **Local Backup Infrastructure**: Uses existing local backup vaults and IAM roles
2. **Cross-Account Replication**: Backup copies replicated to backup account vaults
3. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Leverages existing backup monitoring from Phase 2
4. **Security Controls**: Maintains same encryption and access patterns

## Validation

Created comprehensive validation script (`validate_s3_backup.py`) that checks:

- ✅ Backup policy configuration in all context files
- ✅ BucketBackupPlan construct implementation
- ✅ ProviderUsersBucket backup integration
- ✅ PersistentStack parameter passing
- ✅ Test coverage for S3 backup functionality

## Compliance with Phase 3 Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Document storage backup category | `document_storage` policy in context files | ✅ Complete |
| Daily backups for 1-day RPO | `cron(0 3 * * ? *)` schedule | ✅ Complete |
| Primary data bucket inclusion | `ProviderUsersBucket` with backup plan | ✅ Complete |
| Transitory data bucket exclusion | No backup for `BulkUploadsBucket`, `TransactionReportsBucket` | ✅ Complete |
| Cross-account replication | Copy actions to backup account vault | ✅ Complete |
| Common backup construct usage | `BucketBackupPlan` follows `TableBackupPlan` pattern | ✅ Complete |
| Test coverage | Updated tests validate S3 backup resources | ✅ Complete |

## Next Steps

Phase 3 is now complete and ready for Phase 4 (Cognito User Pool Custom Backup). The S3 backup infrastructure provides:

- **Robust Protection**: Daily backups with 7-year retention
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-account replication for business continuity  
- **Cost Optimization**: Cold storage lifecycle for long-term retention
- **Operational Consistency**: Same monitoring and management as DynamoDB backups

The implementation maintains the distributed backup architecture principles while extending protection to critical document storage resources.
