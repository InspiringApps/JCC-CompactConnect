      I hereby attest and affirm that I have reviewed, understand, and will abide by this state’s practice act, scope of practice, and all applicable laws and rules when practicing in the state. Practice in a state occurs when I am providing services to a client/patient located in that state at the time services are rendered. I understand that the issuance of a Compact Privilege authorizes me to legally practice in the member state only in accordance with the laws and rules governing the practice of my profession in that member state.

      If I violate the state’s practice act, scope of practice, or any applicable laws or rules, the appropriate board may take action against my Compact Privilege, which may result in the revocation of other Compact Privileges or licenses I may hold. I will also be prohibited from obtaining any other Compact Privileges for a period of at least two (2) years.
